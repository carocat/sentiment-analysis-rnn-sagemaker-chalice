# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 
This project from udacity machine learning nanodegree assumes some familiarity with SageMaker.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the udacity root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).

I modified the web application to run with chalice in cloud9 which was not in the scope of the project.
